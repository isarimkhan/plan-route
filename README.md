A separate mini-site showing **ALL** stops and routes on a map. All of them.

Check it out: [Visualization mini-site](https://busrouter.sg/visualization/) (⚠️ Uses a lot of bandwidth).

## Technicalities

### Data

All data such as bus stops, services and routes are mostly _scraped_ from <https://www.lta.gov.sg/>, which means they are copyrighted by the [Land Transport Authority](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/terms-of-use.html).

They are available here: [cheeaun/sgbusdata](https://github.com/cheeaun/sgbusdata).

### Web App

The scripts for the web app:

- `npm start` - start server for development
- `npm run build` - build for production and deployment, in `./dist` folder.

### Localization

**[➡️ Start translating ⬅️](https://crwd.in/busrouter-sg)**

### Visualization

At least Node.js 14 is required.

The scripts to generate the data, in order:

1. `node visualization/build-routes.mjs`
   - Reads `data.busrouter.sg/v1/data/stops.min.json` and transform routes data with "levels" for 3D extrusion.
   - Generates `visualization/data/routes.json` and `visualization/data/levels.json` to be read by the `build-stops` script.
2. `node visualization/build-stops.mjs`
   - Reads `data.busrouter.sg/v1/data/stops.min.geojson` and _buffered_ into triangle polygons which will be 3D-extruded.
   - Generates `visualization/data/stops.3d.json`.
